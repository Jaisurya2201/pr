            THE GREATEST 
            </marquee></h1>    
        <p>
            ☛  “Float like a butterfly; sting like a bee ahhhh! Rumble, young man rumble ahhhh!” 
            Those were the words echoed time and time again from Cassius Clay and his corner man 
            David Brown. Better known as Muhammad Ali, he has a legacy of being the greatest 
            fighter whoever lived. Muhammad Ali has a career record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37 
            knockouts. Just a kid from a southern town of Louisville, Kentucky, raised in a normal 
            middle class family where he and his brother were expected to either work or go to the 
            military; his father was a painter and his mother a housewife. However Cassius Clay would 
            soon become the great Muhammad Ali.   
            <br><br>
            ☛  Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest boxers of all time. Born Cassius Marcellus Clay 
            Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali began boxing at the age of 12. 
            He quickly became known for his speed, agility, and footwork, and he soon developed a 
            unique fighting style that relied on his ability to move quickly and dodge punches.
            <br><br>
            ☛  Throughout his career, Ali fought some of the toughest opponents in the world, 
            including Joe Frazier, George Foreman, and Sonny Liston. He was known for his brash 
            personality, quick wit, and trash talking, which made him one of the most entertaining 
            fighters of all time.
            <br><br>
            ☛  Despite his success in the ring, Ali was also known for his political activism and 
            social advocacy. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and refused to be drafted 
            into the military, citing his religious beliefs and his opposition to the war. This 
            decision cost him his boxing titles and banned him from fighting for three years, but 
            it also made him a symbol of resistance and a hero to many.
            <br><br>
            ☛  Over the years, Ali continued to be involved in social and political issues, including 
            civil rights and humanitarian causes. He traveled extensively, visiting countries around 
            the world and using his fame to draw attention to important issues.
            <br><br>
            ☛  In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological 
            disorder that gradually robbed him of his mobility and speech. Despite this, he 
            continued to make public appearances and to speak out on issues that were important 
            to him. He also worked tirelessly to raise awareness about Parkinson's disease and 
            to support research efforts aimed at finding a cure.
            <br><br>
            ☛  Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, at the age of 74. He is remembered as one of the 
            greatest boxers of all time, as well as a powerful symbol of social justice, 
            political activism, and human resilience.
